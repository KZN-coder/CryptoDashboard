# _Crypto Dashboard_

This is my practice project made during studying FastAPI

Stack:

- Python

Libs:
- Pydantic
- FastAPI
- aiohttp

## Description
Using a FastAPI I've created simple app for connecting to the frontend (the main goal of this project) + settings for CORS. Also added async\_lru (alru\_cache) All libs were installed via Poetry. If you want, you can also check the repo of the frontend for this poject. [Link](https://github.com/KZN-coder/CryptoDashboard_Frontend)
